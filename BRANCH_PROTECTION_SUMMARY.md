## üîí Branch Protection Requirements

Once enabled by repository administrators, the following requirements will be enforced:

### Automatic Checks
- ‚úÖ **Lint**: Code must pass ESLint checks
- ‚úÖ **Build**: Project must build successfully without errors

### Manual Requirements
- ‚úÖ At least **1 approval** from a maintainer
- ‚úÖ All **conversations resolved**
- ‚úÖ Branch **up to date** with main

### Protections
- ‚ùå **No force pushes** to main branch
- ‚ùå **No direct pushes** to main branch (PRs required)
- ‚ùå **No branch deletion** of main branch
- üîê Rules apply to **everyone including administrators**

## üöÄ Next Steps for Repository Administrators

### Step 1: Review This PR
- Review all files added/modified
- Verify workflow configuration is correct
- Check documentation is clear and accurate

### Step 2: Merge This PR
- Merge this PR to add CI workflows and documentation
- The workflows will be active after merging

### Step 3: Enable Branch Protection (Manual)
This **must be done manually** via GitHub settings:

1. Go to: `https://github.com/Bleackh/tanstack-excel-table/settings/branches`

2. Click "Add branch protection rule"

3. Set branch name pattern: `main`

4. Enable the following:
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Require pull request before merging (1 approval)
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Require status checks to pass before merging
     - ‚òëÔ∏è Require branches to be up to date
     - Required checks: `Lint`, `Build` (appear after first workflow run)
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Require conversation resolution before merging
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Do not allow bypassing the above settings
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Rules applied to everyone including administrators
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Allow force pushes: **OFF**
   - ‚òëÔ∏è Allow deletions: **OFF**

5. Save the rule

**Detailed instructions:** See `.github/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Step 4: Test the Setup
1. Create a test PR to trigger the workflow
2. Verify both `Lint` and `Build` checks run successfully
3. Go back to branch protection settings and add the status checks as required
4. Test that protection is working (see `.github/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)

## üìä CI Workflow Details

### Lint Job
- Checks code style and quality using ESLint
- Runs on: Ubuntu Latest
- Duration: ~10-30 seconds
- Command: `pnpm lint`

### Build Job
- Verifies the project builds successfully
- Runs on: Ubuntu Latest
- Duration: ~1-3 minutes
- Command: `pnpm build`

Both jobs run in parallel for faster feedback.

## üí° Benefits

1. **Code Quality**: Ensures all merged code passes linting and builds successfully
2. **Review Process**: Requires at least one approval before merging
3. **Protected History**: Prevents force pushes and maintains clean commit history
4. **Prevents Accidents**: Blocks direct pushes and branch deletion
5. **Consistent Process**: All contributions follow the same workflow
6. **Early Feedback**: CI runs automatically, catching issues early

## üéØ Success Criteria

After this PR is merged and branch protection is enabled:

- ‚úÖ All PRs must pass CI checks before merging
- ‚úÖ All PRs require approval before merging
- ‚úÖ Main branch cannot be force-pushed
- ‚úÖ Main branch cannot be deleted
- ‚úÖ Main branch cannot receive direct pushes
- ‚úÖ Contributors have clear guidelines
- ‚úÖ Documentation is comprehensive and accessible

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Branch protection must be enabled manually** - This PR only adds the CI workflow and documentation. The actual branch protection rules must be configured through GitHub's web interface (see Step 3 above).

2. **Status checks appear after first run** - The `Lint` and `Build` status checks will only appear in the branch protection settings dropdown after the workflow runs at least once. Merge this PR first, then configure the status checks.

3. **Everyone is affected** - When properly configured, these rules apply to all users including administrators. This is intentional for consistency.

4. **CI runs use GitHub Actions minutes** - For public repositories, this is unlimited. For private repositories, this uses the account's Action minutes quota.
